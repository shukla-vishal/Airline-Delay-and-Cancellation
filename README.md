# Airline-Delay-and-Cancellation

The USA has some busiest airports present in the world, so it is quite important for airline 
industries to maintain their service efficiently for smoothing their operations and avoiding flight 
delays. There are many reasons behind the flight delays like airline glitches, congestion in air 
traffic, security issues, weather conditions such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, etc. Flight delay 
affects passengers by increasing the travel time and increasing the cost of food and lodging this 
causes pressure among the travelers. 


The airline operations are also affected due to flight delay as there will be an increase in 
additional crew expenses, also there will be the cost associated with the accommodation of 
passengers affected due to delay and repositioning of the aircraft as the aircraft and crewmember 
schedules are dependent on the scheduled time only.


Also, flight delays indirectly affect the air transport system by increasing their operational 
cost by increasing the number of staff members in order to maintain efficiency thus leading to 
higher business costs. This further affects the overall economy of the airline industries by 
reducing the demands of travelers and as the airline cost increases the flight rates, carrier costs are 
increased and lower the reputation of the airline
